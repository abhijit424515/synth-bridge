## API Testing

Moving on from paid/trial services like Postman, we will be using a CLI tool named [hurl](https://hurl.dev/). The configuration for session storage and data parsing has been completed.

The API test files are in the folder named `hurl`. Any static files relevant for API testing are to be stored in `hurl/static`. Any cookies generated by any API request will be stored in `hurl/cookies.txt`, and will be ignored by git.

Here is an example of testing an API. Let's say we want to test the student login API. On your terminal, use the following command

```bash
./hurl.sh hurl/student/auth/login.hurl
```

Another example involves testing the resume parser API. Make sure to run the login API first, since the resume parser API only works on authenticated users. Run the following command on your terminal

```bash
./hurl.sh hurl/services/resume-parser.hurl
```

If you want to change the input file for this API, simply place the file (say `alpha.pdf`) in the `hurl/static` folder, and replace the file name in the line `file,static/resume.pdf;` with `file,static/alpha.pdf;` inside the `hurl/services/resume-parser.hurl` file.
